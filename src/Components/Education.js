            <p>I graduated from the Full Stack Software Engineering program in January 2020. Learning a wide set of skills starting with Ruby and Ruby on Rails and moving onto Javascript and the React framework. Being on campus with such skilled instructors and coaches was a great inspiration. The school not only taught me the technical skills needed to be a successful programmer but also the mindset and attitude.</p>

            <p>I gained a BSc in Mechanical Engineering whilst at University. This was my first exposure to programming  and scientific software. I learned to produce a product that had been thoroughly tested and stylishly represented using these softwares.</p>

            <p>At school I enjoyed maths and science; particulary physics. I was also part of school sports teams where I was lucky enough to travel to Australia and South Africa in summer tours.</p>
